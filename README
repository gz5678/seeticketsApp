An exercise for interview at seetickets.
A small program which gets data about events and products from a database and calculates the service fee
for buying a certain quantity of products for the event.
DB is sqlite and program is built in flask + sqlalchemy.

Improvements
=============

1. Add to the association table a service fee column where the value is the products service fee if it is not null
and otherwise is the event service fee.


Explanations
=============
1. At first I used the children attribute of the event to get the relevant products. In order to determine the
service fee, I iterated over the products and changed the service fee to the event's service fee if the value
was null. This seemed inefficient to me since it already implicitly queries the database, so it's better to define
the right service fee in query itself. That's why I moved to the join query with coalesce. I might be wrong of course
:)
